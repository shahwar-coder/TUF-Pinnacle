💡 Problem: Count number of odd digits in a number  
You are given an integer `n`.  
You need to return the **number of odd digits** present in the number.
The number will have no leading zeroes, except when the number is `0` itself.
---
### Examples:

Input: n = 5  
Output: 1  
Explanation: 5 is an odd digit.

Input: n = 25  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The only odd digit in 25 is 5.

Input: n = 15  
Output: 2  
Explanation: Both 1 and 5 are odd digits.

---

### Constraints:
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 5000  
- `n` will contain no leading zeroes except when it is `0` itself.
